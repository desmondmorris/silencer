## Silencer - turn down the internet

### An extension for Google Chrome to define terms to be filtered from select websites

* Refactor popup.coffee

* User accounts and NUX
* User tracking (know how many I have) (mixpanel)

* Build on pocket (code should be in Evernote)
* Make it work for other websites (and 1-3 next)
* Sync terms across multiple browsers (via terms stored in a db somewhere)

* Annoying URLs pack (4sq, vine, instagram, nike, path, fb)
* Reserved words pack
