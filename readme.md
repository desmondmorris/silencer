## Silencer - turn down the internet

### An extension for Google Chrome to define terms to be filtered from select websites

To Do:
* Filter on refresh (xhr promise or ajax promise)
* Test with a fresh start (nothing in LS)
* Make sure visual cue of add/remove works

* Release v1 (0.5)

***

* Make it work for other websites (and 1-3 next)
* User tracking (know how many I have)
* User accounts and NUX
