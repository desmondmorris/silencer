## Silencer - turn down the internet

### An extension for Google Chrome to define terms to be filtered from select websites

To Do:
* Let user add terms (loop through, if not in, push)
* Add filterTerms to local storage
* Let user remove terms (loop through, if found, pop/remove)
* Filter on refresh (xhr promise or ajax promise)
