## Silencer - turn down the internet

### An extension for Google Chrome to define terms to be filtered from select websites

To Do:
* Make sure visual cue of remove works

* Nothing. Release to 10-20 people (anyone who wants it in Bold, Bart Lorang, Jay Crain, Jana, Jake Levine, Patrick)

* Release v1 (0.5)

***

* Make it work for other websites (and 1-3 next)
* User tracking (know how many I have)
* Refactor popup.coffee
* User accounts and NUX
* Filter on refresh (xhr promise or ajax promise)
